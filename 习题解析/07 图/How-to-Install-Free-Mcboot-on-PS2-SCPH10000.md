# How to Install Free Mcboot on PS2 SCPH-10000
 
Free Mcboot (FMCB) is a homebrew software that allows you to launch other homebrew applications from your PS2 memory card, without the need for any extra hardware or modifications to your console. FMCB can also be installed on the PS2 hard disk drive (HDD) as Free Harddisk Drive Boot (FHDB), which works with the Sony HDDOSD (Browser update v2.00).

In this article, we will show you how to install FMCB on your PS2 SCPH-10000 model, which is one of the earliest Japanese versions of the console that has a PCMCIA slot instead of a USB port. This model is fully supported by FMCB, but requires a different installation method than other models.
 
## What You Need
 
- A PS2 SCPH-10000 console with a working DVD drive.
- A PS2 memory card (official or compatible).
- A PS2 game disc that is compatible with your console region.
- A PC with a DVD burner and a DVD-R disc.
- The latest version of FMCB installer (v1.966 as of writing).
- The latest version of ESR patcher GUI.
- The latest version of Apache3.

## Step 1: Download and Burn the FMCB Installer
 
First, you need to download the FMCB installer from [this link](https://gbatemp.net/download/free-mcboot-fmcb-v1-966.37626/). Extract the ZIP file and you will find two ISO files: one for normal installation (FMCBInstaller.elf) and one for SCPH-10000 installation (FMCBInstaller\_SCPH-10000.elf). You need to use the latter one for this tutorial.
 
Next, you need to patch the ISO file with ESR patcher GUI, which will make it bootable on your PS2 without any modifications. You can download ESR patcher GUI from [this link](https://www.psx-place.com/resources/esr-gui-test-2.36/). Run the program and select the FMCBInstaller\_SCPH-10000.elf ISO file as the input file and click "Patch". A new ISO file will be created with "\_patched" in its name.
 
Finally, you need to burn the patched ISO file to a DVD-R disc using a program like ImgBurn or Nero. Make sure you use the lowest possible speed and verify the disc after burning.
 
## Step 2: Prepare Your Memory Card
 
Before you can install FMCB on your memory card, you need to format it using the PS2 browser. Insert your memory card into slot 1 of your PS2 and turn on your console without any disc inside. You will see the browser screen with two icons: one for your memory card and one for your CD/DVD drive.
 
Select your memory card icon and press X. You will see a list of files and folders on your memory card. Press Triangle to open the menu and select "Format". Confirm by pressing X twice. Wait until the formatting process is done and press X again to exit.
 
## Step 3: Install FMCB on Your Memory Card
 
Now you are ready to install FMCB on your memory card. Insert the DVD-R disc that you burned in step 1 into your PS2 and turn on your console. You will see a screen with "ESR" logo and then a black screen with some text. Wait until you see "Press X to launch FMCB installer" and press X.
 
You will see the FMCB installer menu with several options. Select "Normal Install" and press X. The installer will detect your memory card and ask you to confirm if you want to install FMCB on it. Press X to confirm and wait until the installation process is done.
 
When the installation is finished, you will see a message saying "Installation completed successfully". Press X to exit the installer and
